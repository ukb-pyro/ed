Got you, Pyromancer. Here’s a tight, do-this-now plan that (1) makes Edward STEM-OPT eligible at Ukubona and (2) lines up real funding paths—without hand-wavy grants that he can’t actually get.

# 0) Quick reality check (so we don’t waste effort)

* **STEM-OPT**: hinges on Edward’s **degree CIP code** being on DHS’s STEM list and the job being directly related. Employer **must** be in **E-Verify** and a formal **I-983 training plan** is required. NAICS is recorded on the I-983 but is **not** what grants the eligibility itself. ([SBIR][1], [USCIS][2], [Study in the States][3])
* **Paid, 20+ hrs/wk**: STEM-OPT work **cannot be unpaid**; min **20 hrs/week**; compensation must be **commensurate with similarly-situated U.S. workers**. ([OISS][4], [USCIS][5], [Study in the States][6])
* **“PhD makes him eligible for lots of U.S. federal fellowships”**: careful—many marquee U.S. fellowships (NSF GRFP, DOE SCGSR, DOE CSGF, NDSEG) are **citizen/PR-only**. A PhD still opens university RA/TA support and **industry/private** fellowships that **don’t require U.S. citizenship** (see §4). ([NSF - National Science Foundation][7], [Office of Science][8], [krellinst.org][9])

# 1) Make Edward STEM-OPT-eligible at Ukubona (fast path)

**A. Confirm the degree is on the STEM list**

* Ask his registrar/DSO for the **CIP code** on the I-20. Cross-check on DHS’s **STEM Designated Degree Program List** (engineering, comp sci, many energy programs qualify). ([SBIR][1])

**B. Enroll Ukubona in E-Verify (if not already)**

* Enroll and get the **E-Verify Company ID** (one-time). Use USCIS’s enrollment flow + checklist. ([E-Verify][10])

**C. Choose a clean NAICS (for I-983 Section 3)**
Pick the one that best matches *his* training plan (any of these are fine; primary should reflect revenue focus):

* **541715** – R\&D in physical/engineering/life sciences (great umbrella for AI+energy+health).
* **541511** – Custom computer programming (if his work is primarily ML/algorithm dev).
* **518210** – Data processing/hosting (if Ukubona is operating/hosting compute).
* **541690** – Other scientific & technical consulting (if it’s advisory-heavy). ([Census.gov][11])

**D. Draft the I-983 (training plan)**
Include: objectives, supervision, methods of evaluation, resources, hours (≥20), and **paid** compensation. Submit **before** the STEM-OPT application. (You’ll also do a **12-month** and **final** evaluation.) ([Study in the States][3])

**Paste-ready I-983 skeleton (Section 5: Training Plan)**
*Job title:* Energy & Compute Simulation Analyst (STEM)
*Direct relationship to degree:* Applies energy systems/EE/CS coursework to parallelized simulations for compute-intensive modeling.
*Learning objectives (skills/knowledge):*
• Build & validate energy-demand and grid-reliability models; • Optimize parallel pipelines (vectorized + distributed) for **AI-assisted forecasting**; • Operate HPC/cloud (batch, autoscaling); • MLOps (testing, monitoring); • Reproducible science (docs, versioning).
*How objectives are achieved:*
• Weekly sprints; paired code reviews; dataset curation; benchmark suites; deploy on controlled cloud/HPC; incident retros; reading group (energy + RL/controls).
*Oversight & supervision:*
• Supervisor: \[Name, Title, email]. 1:1 weekly; code reviews; quarterly performance rubric.
*Measures & evaluation:*
• SLAs (runtime, cost/forecast error); reproducible notebooks; unit/integration test coverage; quarterly demo; 12-mo & final I-983 evaluations.
*Employer resources:*
• GPU/CPU credits; orchestration; secured data access; senior engineer mentorship.
*Hours & pay:*
• **≥20 hrs/week**, paid **$\[amount]/\[period]**, commensurate with similarly-situated U.S. workers. ([ICE][12])

**E. Reporting rhythm**
6-month validations via DSO; **12-month** and **final (24-month)** evaluations on the I-983; report material changes within **10 days**. ([Study in the States][13])

# 2) Map it to your pentad (so it “clicks”)

* **Play / Seed** → *Hire + fund*: lock E-Verify, file I-983, shortlist fellowships/SBIRs. ([Study in the States][14])
* **Ontology / Animal** → *Operationalize*: choose NAICS (541715/541511/518210/541690) and write duties that mirror the degree. ([Census.gov][11])
* **Agency / Man** → *Edward’s path*: F-1 → OPT → **STEM-OPT** with paid, ≥20 hrs/wk role under real supervision. ([USCIS][5])
* **Epistemology / Enterprise** → *Ukubona NAICS & controls*: proper training plan, evaluations, DSO reporting. ([Study in the States][3])
* **Frailty / System** → *Compute → energy*: design for parallelism & energy cost curves; fund via SBIR/ARPA-E/NSF-SBIR. ([seedfund.nsf.gov][15], [Office of Science][16], [arpa-e-foa.energy.gov][17])

---

# 3) Two-week checklist (you can literally run this)

**Week 1**

1. Confirm Edward’s **CIP** on the STEM list. ([SBIR][1])
2. Enroll Ukubona in **E-Verify**; capture Company ID. ([E-Verify][10])
3. Pick **primary NAICS** for I-983 (recommend **541715** for your R\&D posture). ([Census.gov][11])
4. Draft **I-983** using the skeleton above; set hours (≥20) and compensation. ([ICE][12])

**Week 2**
5\) Submit I-983 to DSO; file STEM-OPT. ([Study in the States][3])
6\) Start **SBIR/ARPA-E** scoping: pick a single topic and back-solve the technical aims. Use current cycles:

* **NSF SBIR Phase I** next windows include **Nov 5, 2025**. Start with a **Project Pitch** if needed. ([seedfund.nsf.gov][15])
* **DOE SBIR FY2025** Release 2 topics were pre-released; watch FOA timing and topic webinars. ([Office of Science][16])
* **ARPA-E** maintains active FOAs (check eXCHANGE). ([arpa-e-foa.energy.gov][17])

---

# 4) Grants & fellowships Edward can actually pursue

**Citizen/PR-only (list for awareness, not immediate):**

* **NSF GRFP** (citizen/PR only). ([NSF - National Science Foundation][7])
* **DOE SCGSR** (citizen/PR only). ([Office of Science][8])
* **DOE CSGF** (citizen/PR only). ([krellinst.org][9])
* **NDSEG** (citizen only). ([Wikipedia][18])

**Open to **non-U.S. citizens**** (strong options once he’s in a PhD):

* **Google PhD Fellowship** (U.S./Canada track: nomination only; **no citizenship requirement**). Great for AI/Systems/energy-ML. ([E-Verify][10])
* **Microsoft Research PhD Fellowship** (U.S./Canada; **no citizenship requirement**, nomination based). ([USCIS][2])
* **NVIDIA Graduate Fellowship** (global; heavy compute focus—perfect for “intelligence ← compute ← parallel processing”). ([E-Verify][19])
* **University RA/TA & internal energy fellowships** (typically open to international students; varies by school—Edward’s best steady funding once admitted).

**Company-level funding you (Ukubona) can drive:**

* **NSF SBIR** (no PI citizenship requirement; company must be U.S.-owned; 51% U.S. citizen/PR ownership). Edward can be a key employee on OPT. ([NSF - National Science Foundation][20], [Office of Science][21])
* **DOE SBIR** (same U.S.-owned rule; Release calendars above). ([Office of Science][16])
* **ARPA-E** FOAs (company-led proposals welcome). ([arpa-e-foa.energy.gov][17])

---

# 5) Mini job description (fits I-983 + grant aims)

**Energy & Compute Simulation Analyst (STEM)**

* Build AI-assisted **energy demand** & **grid reliability** models;
* Design **parallel pipelines** (GPU/CPU) to reduce cost/latency of simulations tied to Ukubona’s decision models;
* Implement **MLOps** for reproducible experiments;
* Co-author SBIR/ARPA-E aims on **compute-efficiency → energy footprint** gains.

This keeps the work squarely **STEM**, clearly related to his degree, **paid** (≥20 hrs), and under bona fide supervision—checking all STEM-OPT boxes. ([USCIS][5], [Study in the States][3])

---

# 6) Paperwork & links (one place)

* **STEM list (CIP)** → DHS/ICE STEM Designated Degree Program List. ([SBIR][1])
* **STEM-OPT rules** → USCIS STEM-OPT overview + I-983 overview. ([USCIS][2], [Study in the States][3])
* **I-983 (form + instructions)** → ICE PDFs. ([ICE][22])
* **E-Verify enrollment** → USCIS E-Verify. ([E-Verify][10])
* **NAICS reference** → Census 541511 / 518210 / 541690. ([Census.gov][11])
* **SBIR calendars** → DOE FY2025 / NSF SBIR deadlines. ([Office of Science][16], [seedfund.nsf.gov][15])
* **ARPA-E FOAs** → eXCHANGE. ([arpa-e-foa.energy.gov][17])

## TL;DR

1. Confirm Edward’s **CIP** is on the STEM list → Enroll Ukubona in **E-Verify** → File a **paid**, **≥20 hr/wk** role with an I-983 that says “energy simulations on parallel compute.” ([SBIR][1], [E-Verify][10], [ICE][12])
2. For funding, **company-led** SBIR/ARPA-E is your near-term lever; once he’s in a **PhD**, target **Google/Microsoft/NVIDIA** PhD fellowships (citizenship not required). ([seedfund.nsf.gov][15], [arpa-e-foa.energy.gov][17], [E-Verify][10], [USCIS][2])
