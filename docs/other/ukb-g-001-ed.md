## Summary


### Ukubona LLC: A Linguistic Journey


Ukubona shared his experience of registering a company called Ukubona LLC in Virginia and explained the etymology of the name, which is derived from the Zulu word "kubona" meaning "to see." He discussed how the word has similar meanings across various African languages, including Swahili and Luganda, despite slight variations in pronunciation and spelling. Edward expressed interest in the linguistic connections and suggested that a deeper discussion on the historical origins of these words could be valuable in the future.

### Ukubona's STEM-Focused Company Origins


Ukubona explained the origins of his company, which was founded to retain a former student who qualified for STEM eligibility and had completed two years of a grant-funded program. The company, which started in March 2024, is currently in its fourth month of operation and has been providing services since June. Ukubona also mentioned that he is defending his PhD thesis in clinical investigations, which is based on a grant running from 2020 to December 2024, and that the company's ideas are derived from this research.

### Kidney Donation Risk Calculator Development


Ukubona discussed the development of a risk calculator for kidney donation, which personalizes risk assessment using data science and AI tools. He shared his journey of learning data science and using ChatGPT to streamline software development, emphasizing the importance of copying and pasting code into a development environment. Ukubona also explained the background of his company, which was registered to align with his mentee's degree and to enable hiring in the STEM field, with a future goal of financial success.

They also discussed the likelihood of success for the grant application, with Ukubona suggesting ways to estimate probabilities based on past applicants.

### AI Energy Demand Correlation


Ukubona discussed the correlation between artificial intelligence and energy demand, emphasizing that as intelligence scales, so does the energy required for computation. He clarified that the focus is on supply-demand economics rather than environmental values, explaining that the energy needs for AI and simulations are driven by the need for future-focused decision-making and consequence analysis. Ukubona also highlighted the relevance of video game technology to AI development and the massive investments being made in AI infrastructure, concluding that quantifying energy demand should be the first step before considering clean energy goals.

### Grant and PhD Application Planning


Ukubona discussed a plan involving grant applications and potential PhD opportunities, explaining the timelines and financial aspects involved. They emphasized the importance of PhD applications, which typically occur in November or December, and offered support for the application process. Edward expressed interest in the proposal and agreed to review the updated document Ukubona would send, clarifying any questions or concerns.

### OPT Employment and Extension Planning


Edward discussed his current situation of seeking employment opportunities while on OPT (Optional Practical Training) authorization, which expires in June 2026. He explained that he needs to find a volunteer or paid internship that would count towards the 12-month STEM extension, requiring at least 20 hours per week. Ukubona offered to help by providing a role that would be DHS and school-approved, mentioning that the company is e-verified and can offer a position that aligns with Edward's major. They agreed to further discuss the details of the role and the necessary documentation, including the I-9 form and DHS verification.

### Edward's Remote Internship Onboarding
