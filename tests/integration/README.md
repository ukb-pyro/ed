# A
Here’s a focused **plan of operations** from now until the next Ukubona LLC × Edward meeting, framed against your pentad and the directory structure you’ve defined.

---

## **Frailty / System — Industry-Wide Energy Needs**

* **Quantify compute–energy correlations**

  * Outline how Ukubona’s anticipated compute growth translates into power demand.
  * Identify parallel industries (AI, biotech, gaming) with similar exponential scaling needs.
  * Create a one-page summary for grant narratives and NAICS positioning.
* **Scan regulatory & market signals**

  * Check DOE, ARPA-E, and industry whitepapers for near-term energy priorities that could fund cross-disciplinary projects.

---

## **Epistemology / Enterprise — Ukubona LLC NAICS**

* **Confirm STEM-eligible NAICS**

  * Review current registered NAICS code in Virginia records.
  * If needed, amend to one of:

    * 541715 — Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Nanotechnology and Biotechnology)
    * 541330 — Engineering Services
* **Cross-map** NAICS → grants → Edward’s degree CIP code to ensure DHS STEM list match.
* **Add to repo**

  * Store NAICS docs in `/compliance/stem-opt/` for DHS reference.

---

## **Agency / Man — OPT STEM for Edward**

* **E-Verify check**: Confirm Ukubona is active in E-Verify and store proof in `/compliance/stem-opt/e-verify/`.
* **Draft Edward’s job description**:

  * Position: *Energy Simulation Analyst*.
  * Tie duties to Edward’s degree (energy/environmental systems) and Ukubona’s simulation/data pipelines.
  * Save in `/people/edward/training-plan/`.
* **Training plan narrative**: Start first draft of I-983 Section 5, linking Edward’s role to measurable STEM skill growth.

---

## **Ontology / Animal — Prepare OPT STEM paperwork**

* **Form I-983**

  * Fill employer info, NAICS, E-Verify details, and supervisory structure.
  * Draft learning objectives (e.g., Python simulation dev, energy-health system modeling, DOE grant writing).
* **Internal approval chain**:

  * Circulate draft to Edward → his DSO → Ukubona’s compliance folder for archiving.
* **I-9 update**: Keep in `/compliance/stem-opt/` with supporting docs.

---

## **Play / Seed — Grants**

* **Eligibility check**:

  * Confirm Edward’s degree CIP code on DHS list.
  * Confirm NAICS match to grant categories.
* **Shortlist active calls**:

  * DOE SCGSR (Nov)
  * ARPA-E OPEN (rolling)
  * SBIR/STTR Phase I (DOE/NIH)
* **Grant folder prep**:

  * `/grants/doe-sbir/` → quad chart + 1-pager.
  * `/grants/arpa-e/` → concept summary (AI for energy-health optimization).
* **Assign writing leads**: Edward drafts technical aims; Ukubona handles commercialization/impact.

---

## **Execution Cadence**

* **Daily**:

  * Edward logs progress in `/people/edward/learning-log/`.
* **Weekly**:

  * Sync on NAICS + Form I-983 updates.
  * Review grant deadlines in `/grants/calendars/`.
* **By next meeting**:

  * NAICS confirmed.
  * I-983 first draft ready.
  * At least one grant concept note complete.

---

If you want, I can also **pre-fill the Form I-983 sections** so you and Edward can just drop in names/dates/signatures. That would speed things up and make DHS/DSO approval smoother. Would you like me to draft that?


# B
Got it — here’s a **pre-filled Form I-983** draft for Edward’s **STEM OPT** at Ukubona LLC, based on what you’ve described.
You’ll just need to drop in dates, signatures, and any school-specific DSO details before sending it for review.

If you want, I can **drop this into a clean .docx or .pdf template** with your directory-ready structure so you can store it under:

```
/compliance/stem-opt/i-983/edward-i983-draft.docx
```

Do you want me to generate that formatted version now? That way it’s ready for Edward & DSO signature.
